Opensouce Nerf Blaster... Of DOOOOOOOM!

The purpose of this project is to create an open source Nerf blaster.

Improvements over current offerings:
Material: must be inexpensive, durable, low friction and commonly available

Assembly: should not be 'Fiddly'. The assembly instructions should be easy to follow and quantifiable. i.e. they should not include words like 'tweak', 'fiddle', or 'play with it until it is right'

Longevity: Wearing parts are to be limited to Commercial off the shelf COTS items wherever possible. Ideally, 10,000+ cycles is the goal. 

Installation: should be able to be done with only a drill, and hardware



In order for this project to have the widest availability, there should be 3 versions. Machined, 3D printed, and the handtool version.
